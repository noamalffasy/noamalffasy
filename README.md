### Hi there! I'm Noam!

- I'm a 17 year old self-taught developer based in Israel
- I mainly work in **TypeScript** but I also work with **Swift** and **Python** on different projects
- Iâ€™m currently learning logic gates and the basic components of a computer (through [Nand2Tetris](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer?)) alongside school
- I also maintain [a WhatsApp bot library](https://github.com/noamalffasy/js-whatsapp)
